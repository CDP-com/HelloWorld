	<p>Show how a SnapBack App is a solution to an asked question on sites like SuperUser.com.  Many sites offer written solutions that advise, if you hand-type or apply the fix.  Often, the solutions published vary in quality, method, have no error handling, and require more context and understanding than most users have. By simply referring them to that specific App's page, users on that site can simply choose to and safely apply that fix with a single click, (or first install SnapBack).  Read "best practices" and "example answers" to a posted problem, using links to a specific SnapBack App page.</p>

	<p><strong>The SnapBack Apps Factory is a platform where</strong> regular users interact with, or become App contributors and developers themselves.  Most technology products initially frustrates users unnecessarily.  If new versions were produced daily, users and developers were constantly communicating, products would quickly evolve to work perfectly.  SnapBack Apps' mission is to modify how any existing hardware and software interacts with ordinary users.   Our Factory connects users, contributors and developers in near real time to create or improve SnapBack Apps.  Changes that are apparently required are quickly communicated, applied and deployed to all users within hours.  Eventually, all changes that any user would ever want, are created and deployed.  The SnapBack Apps Factory platform is where contributors and users of all kinds communicate, design, and ultimately work together to accomplish this mission.</p>
